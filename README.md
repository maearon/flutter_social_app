- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

```
Please analyze the React Native TypeScript project located in the `react-native-boilerplate` directory on the right.

Then, generate a fully functional Flutter (Dart) application that replicates the entire functionality, structure, and UI behavior of this React Native app as closely as possible.

Requirements:

- The resulting Flutter app should implement the same screen structure and navigation flow as found in `react-native-boilerplate/src/screens`.
- Replicate all Zustand-based state management logic using equivalent solutions in Flutter (e.g., Riverpod, Provider, or Bloc).
- Replicate Ky-based API calls using `http`, `dio`, or any modern Flutter HTTP client.
- Ensure API behavior is preserved:
  - Automatically call the `/refresh` API endpoint on receiving a 401 Unauthorized response.
  - Call the `/revoke` API endpoint when the user logs out.
- Recreate all screens using Flutter's mobile-friendly widgets and layouts.
- Ensure all UI is fully optimized for mobile usage:
  - Safe area handling
  - Scrollable content
  - Touch-friendly UI
  - Navigation using `go_router`, `auto_route`, or other best-practice solutions
- The entire app must be in English only. Do not include Vietnamese or other languages.

You may create any necessary files, folders, or packages inside the `flutter_social_app` directory. Use Dart and Flutter best practices throughout the generated codebase.

Thank you!
